#Insurance Quote App

This app provides a quote on the recommended term life insurance needed based on a formula.

The app has two validations: (1) server side validation via ActiveRecord and (2) html5 client side validations.

I added an Rspec test to test the calculation.

You can run the app locally on localhost:3000.

To run the app do the following:
1. Make sure you have postgresql installed.
2. `rails s`
3. Open the browser and go to `localhost:3000`

We can discuss the rest on the phone.
